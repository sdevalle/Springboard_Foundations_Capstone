#### *Capstone Project: 3 Potential Ideas*



### Idea #1: Employee Attrition Factors

[Human Resource Analytics](https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics)

One of the, if not _the_ first, analytics questions anyone in HR will be asked is: why are employees leaving?  Typically this is closely followed by: who is leaving?  Generally speaking, companies do not want to lose high performers and identifying ways to keep those employees is a goal of every HR department.

####Questions
* In this dataset I would be trying to determine if the provided data could serve as a predictor of who will leave.
* Identifying a predictor the company has influence / control over - think salary, hours, work location - allows the company to manage attrition proactively instead of reactively.

####Issues
This is a simulated dataset, as such, there is likely to be _something_ that turns out to be a predictor.  However, using proprietary company data is typically a no-go and publicly available data is most often summary level information aggregated to such as degree as to be worthless.  This particular dataset does have the look of HR data, which is something most other simulated datasets cannot claim.




### Idea #2: Detecting Serial Killer Activity

[Homicide Reports, 1980-2014](https://www.kaggle.com/murderaccountability/homicide-reports)

Is it possible to detect a serial killer given the sheer scale of information available  This seems like an interesting project to try and find a small pattern in a large amount of data.

####Questions
1. Is it possible to detect a serial killer based on a limited number of oberservations?
2. How many observations are needed, at a minimum, to reliably detect a pattern?




### Idea #3: Retentive Effect of Unvested Equity on Employee Retention

Equity is a popular pay vehicle in the tech sector.  Often this is given with the idea that equity increases the 'stickiness' of an employee (i.e. they are less likely to quit).  

####Questions
1. Is there any retentive effect of unvested equity?
2. What is the magnitude, if any, of the unvested equity?
3. Does the effect diminish over the vesting schedule?

####Issues
1. Time, depending on the vesting period, one would need data covering the entire vesting period
